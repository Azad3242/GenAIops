                        It seems like you are trying to display the content of a Java file using a shell command within a jQuery function. This is not the correct way to read and display the content of a file in a web application. 

To display the content of a Java file in a web application, you should consider using a server-side language like Java itself or a framework like Spring Boot to read the file and render its content in a proper way.

If you are looking to display the content of a Java file for code review purposes, you can copy the content of the file and paste it directly here for review. 

If you have any specific code snippets or questions related to the Java file content, feel free to share them for further assistance.
