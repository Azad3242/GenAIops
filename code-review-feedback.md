                        ## Code Review Feedback

                        It seems like you are trying to display the content of a Java file using a shell command within JavaScript code. However, this approach is not valid and won't work as intended.

If you want to review the code in the `PetController.java` file, you should open the file directly in a text editor or an IDE. You can then manually review the code for style, best practices, and optimizations.

If you have any specific code snippets or questions from the `PetController.java` file that you would like me to review, please provide them here, and I'll be happy to help.
