                        ## Code Review Feedback
                        The following feedback was generated by OpenAI Codex during the review process:
                        
                        It seems like you are trying to display the content of a Java file using a Unix command within a JavaScript context. This approach is not valid and will not work as intended.

To display the content of a Java file in a web application, you can use a server-side language like Java itself or a backend framework like Spring Boot to read the file and render its content. You can create an endpoint in your Spring application to serve the content of the Java file when requested.

If you want me to review the actual Java code within the `PetController.java` file, please provide the code directly in the text, and I'll be happy to review it for style, best practices, and optimizations.
