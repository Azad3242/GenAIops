                        It seems like you are trying to view the content of a Java file using a command that reads the file content. However, the command you provided is not correct for viewing the content of a Java file. 

To view the content of a Java file, you can use a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code. These tools provide syntax highlighting, code formatting, and other features that make it easier to read and review code.

If you have specific code snippets or sections that you would like me to review for style, best practices, and optimizations, please provide them directly in the text so that I can assist you better.
