                        It seems like you are trying to display the content of a Java file using a command that reads the file and outputs its content. However, the command `cat` is typically used in a terminal or command line interface, not directly in a code file.

To properly include the content of a Java file in your code, you can use a code snippet or a code block in your documentation or comments. Here is an example of how you can include the content of a Java file in your code:

```java
// Insert the content of PetController.java here
// This is where you can include and describe the relevant code snippets from the file
```

By using this approach, you can provide context and description along with the code snippets from the Java file. This will make it easier for readers to understand the purpose and functionality of the code without having to navigate to the actual file.
