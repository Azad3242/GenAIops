                        It seems like you are trying to read the content of a Java file using a shell command within a jQuery function in a web application. This approach is not recommended as it is not secure and can lead to potential security vulnerabilities.

Instead, you should read the content of the Java file on the server-side using appropriate server-side code (e.g., Java code in a servlet or Spring controller) and then send the content to the client-side (jQuery) for display.

If you need assistance with reading the content of a Java file in a secure manner, please provide more details about your application's architecture and I can help you with the appropriate approach.
