                        ## Code Review Feedback
                        The following feedback was generated by OpenAI Codex during the review process:
                        
                        It seems like you are trying to display the content of a Java file using a shell command within a jQuery function. This approach is not recommended as it can lead to security vulnerabilities and is not a standard practice for code review.

Instead, you should review the code directly in your code editor or IDE. Look for the following aspects in the code:

1. **Style**: Check if the code follows the coding conventions and style guidelines of the project or organization. Look for consistent indentation, naming conventions, and formatting.

2. **Best Practices**: Ensure that the code follows best practices for the framework being used (Spring in this case). Check for proper error handling, use of design patterns, and adherence to Spring best practices.

3. **Optimizations**: Look for any performance bottlenecks or inefficient code patterns. Check if there are any redundant operations that can be optimized for better performance.

If you need specific feedback on the code itself, please copy and paste the relevant parts of the `PetController.java` file here, and I'd be happy to provide a detailed review.
