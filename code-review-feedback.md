                        ## Code Review Feedback
                        The following feedback was generated by OpenAI Codex during the review process:
                        
                        It seems like you are trying to display the content of a Java file using a command that reads the file and outputs its content. However, the command `cat` is typically used in a terminal or command line interface, not in a code file.

To display the content of a Java file in a more appropriate way within your code, you can use a text editor or an IDE to open and view the file directly. This will provide a more user-friendly and readable way to review the code.

If you need assistance with reviewing the actual content of the Java file or have specific questions about the code within `PetController.java`, please copy and paste the relevant sections here, and I'd be happy to help with the review.
