                        ## Code Review Feedback
                        The following feedback was generated by OpenAI Codex during the review process:
        
                        It seems like you are trying to use a command that reads the content of a file and then passes it to jQuery's `$()` function, which is not a valid way to include a file in your JavaScript code. 

If you are trying to include the content of a Java file in your JavaScript code, you should consider a different approach. One common way to include server-side code in a web application is to use a server-side templating engine or to make an HTTP request to fetch the content dynamically.

If you provide more context or clarify your intention, I can provide more specific guidance on how to achieve your goal effectively.
