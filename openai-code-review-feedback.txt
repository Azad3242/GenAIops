This is not the correct way to read and display the content of a file in a web application.\n\nTo display the content of a Java file in a web application, you should consider using a server-side technology like Java itself or a server-side framework like Spring Boot. You can create a controller that reads the content of the Java file and passes it to a view for rendering.\n\nIf you are looking to display code snippets on a web page, you can use syntax highlighting libraries like Prism.js or highlight.js to format and display code in a more readable way.\n\nIn terms of code review, the current approach is not suitable for displaying Java file content in a web application. Consider using appropriate server-side techniques and libraries for achieving this functionality.",
