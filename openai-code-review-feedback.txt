However, the `cat` command is typically used in a Unix-like environment to concatenate and display files, and it is not suitable for reading Java source code within a Java project.\n\nTo properly review the code for style, best practices, and optimizations, you should open the `PetController.java` file in a text editor or an IDE and review its content directly. Once you have the actual code available, I'd be happy to help you with the review.",
