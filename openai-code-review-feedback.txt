It seems like you are trying to use the `cat` command to display the content of a Java file in the terminal. However, the syntax you provided is incorrect for executing shell commands within this context.

To review the code for style, best practices, and optimizations, you can directly paste the content of the `PetController.java` file here, and I will be happy to provide feedback on it. Alternatively, you can upload the file, and I can review it for you. Let me know how you would like to proceed.
