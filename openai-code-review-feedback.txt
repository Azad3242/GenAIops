This approach is not recommended as it can lead to security vulnerabilities and is not a standard practice for code review.\n\nInstead, you should manually open the `PetController.java` file in an editor or IDE, review its content, and provide feedback based on the actual code.\n\nIf you have any specific sections of code that you would like me to review, please copy and paste them here directly. I'll be happy to help you with the review.",
