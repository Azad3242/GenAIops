It seems like you are trying to read the content of a Java file using a shell command within a JavaScript environment. This is not the correct way to review code. 

To properly review the code for style, best practices, and optimizations, you should copy and paste the content of the `PetController.java` file directly into this chat. I will then be able to provide you with a detailed review.
