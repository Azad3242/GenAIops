This is not a valid way to read a file in JavaScript. \n\nTo display the contents of a Java file in a web application, you would typically need to read the file on the server-side (using a backend language like Java) and then send the contents to the frontend (using a technology like AJAX or REST API).\n\nIf you have the Java file content stored in a variable in JavaScript, you can display it in the console or on the webpage using JavaScript functions like `console.log()` or `document.write()`. \n\nIf you provide more context or clarify your requirements, I can help you with the specific implementation.",
