This is not the correct way to read and display the content of a Java file in a web application.\n\nTo display the content of a Java file in a web application, you should consider reading the file server-side and then rendering it in the response to the client. Using JavaScript to read server-side files directly is not a secure or recommended practice.\n\nIf you are looking to review the code within the `PetController.java` file, you should open the file in a text editor or an IDE, and then manually review the code for style, best practices, and optimizations.\n\nIf you have any specific code snippets or questions from the `PetController.java` file that you would like me to review, please provide them here, and I'll be happy to help with the review.",
