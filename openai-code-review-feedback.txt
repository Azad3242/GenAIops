This is not the correct way to read and display the content of a Java file in a web application.\n\nTo properly display the content of a Java file in a web application, you should consider using a server-side language like Java itself or a framework like Spring Boot to read the file content and then render it in the browser.\n\nIf you are looking to display the content of a Java file in a different context, please provide more details so that I can assist you further.",
