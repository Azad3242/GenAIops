                        ## Code Review Feedback
                        The following feedback was generated by OpenAI Codex during the review process:
        
                        It seems like you are trying to display the content of a Java file using a shell command within the context of a JavaScript code snippet. This is not the correct way to read and display the content of a Java file in a web application.

To display the content of a Java file in a web application, you should consider reading the file server-side and then rendering it in the response to the client. Using JavaScript to read server-side files directly is not a secure or recommended practice.

If you are looking to review the code within the `PetController.java` file, you should open the file in a text editor or an IDE, and then manually review the code for style, best practices, and optimizations.

If you have any specific code snippets or questions from the `PetController.java` file that you would like me to review, please provide them here, and I'll be happy to help with the review.
