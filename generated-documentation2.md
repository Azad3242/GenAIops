                        ## Code Review Feedback
                        The following feedback was generated by OpenAI Codex during the review process:
                        
                        It seems like you are trying to use the `cat` command to display the content of a Java file in the terminal. However, the command `cat` is typically used in a Unix-like environment to concatenate and display the contents of files. 

If you are looking to review the code in the `PetController.java` file for style, best practices, and optimizations, you should open the file in a code editor or an IDE that supports Java syntax highlighting and code analysis. This will allow you to properly review the code and provide feedback on its structure, style, and potential optimizations.

If you have any specific code snippets or questions from the `PetController.java` file that you would like me to review, please provide them here, and I'd be happy to help with the review.
